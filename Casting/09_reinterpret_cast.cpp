/**
 * TOPIC:reinterpret_cast in C++
 * Definition:
 *  reinterpret_cast is a type of casting operator used to forcefully convert one 
 *  pointer type to another. This is a low-level cast and is often used when you 
 *  need to treat a block of memory as a different type, regardless of the actual 
 *  type that was originally stored in that memory.
 * 
 * Syntax:
 *  reinterpret_cast<new_type>(expression)
 * 
 *        new_type: The type you want to cast to (it could be a pointer or reference type).
 *        expression: The value being cast, usually a pointer or reference.
 * 
 * Key Characteristics:

    1. Dangerous and Unreliable:
        reinterpret_cast doesn't perform any kind of safety check or validation. 
        It simply converts one type to another at the memory level.
        This makes it unsafe and non-portable, meaning its behavior can vary across 
        different compilers and platforms.

    2. Use Case:
        It's typically used in low-level programming, like interacting with 
        hardware or dealing with specific memory layouts. It's also used to cast 
        between pointer types that are not related, such as converting a char* to 
        an int*.

    3. No Conversion:
        reinterpret_cast does not change the actual bits of the object. It just 
        reinterprets the pointer as pointing to a different type.

    4. Casting Pointers to Integers (and vice versa):
        It can be used to cast pointer types to integer types and vice versa.
        This can be useful for low-level memory manipulation.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num = 42;
    int* intPtr = &num;
    
    // Reinterpret int pointer as a char pointer
    char* charPtr = reinterpret_cast<char*>(intPtr);
    
    // Print the raw bytes of the integer (memory of the integer, interpreted as char)
    cout << "Interpreted as char: " << *charPtr << endl;

    return 0;
}

/**
 * Explanation:

    1. Memory Layout:
        The variable num is of type int and stores the value 42.
        In memory, 42 is stored as a sequence of bytes that represent the integer value.

    2. Reinterpreting the Pointer:
    char* charPtr = reinterpret_cast<char*>(intPtr);
    changes the type of intPtr (which is an int*) to a char*.

    The important thing here is that reinterpret_cast does not change the actual 
    data in memory, it only changes how we interpret the memory.

    3. Accessing Memory:
    When you dereference charPtr:
    cout << "Interpreted as char: " << *charPtr << endl;
    You are treating the first byte of the memory (where num is stored) as a char. 
    This can lead to unexpected results.
    Typically, on most systems, an int is stored in 4 bytes. So when you access 
    the first byte, you'll get the lowest byte of the integer value. 
    On little-endian systems (which is common on most machines), the least 
    significant byte comes first.

    4. Byte Representation of 42:
    The integer 42 (in hexadecimal) is 0x2A
    In memory (little-endian), this would likely be stored as:
    [0x2A] [0x00] [0x00] [0x00]
    So, when you access the first byte as a char, you'll get 0x2A, which is the 
    character corresponding to the byte value 42 in ASCII.
    However, the value printed is not the integer 42, but the character 
    corresponding to the byte 0x2A, which is '%' in ASCII.
