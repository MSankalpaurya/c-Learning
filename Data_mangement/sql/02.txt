Data TYPES:
data types of a colummn defines what value the column can store in table

defines while creating tables in database

Data types mainly classified into thee categories + most used

1. string : char , varchar
2. numeric : int, float, bool
3. date and time : date, datetime

Primary Key (PK) :
   a primary key is a unique column we set in a table easily identify and locate data in query
   A table can have one primary key, which shuld be unique and not NULL

Foreign Keys(FK) :

   A foreign key is a column used to connect two or more table
   A table can have many number of foreign keys, can contain duplicate and NULL value


Constraints:
   Constrainets are used to sepecify rules for data in a table
   this ensure the accuracy and reliabilty of the data in the table
   Constraints can be specified when the table is created with the CREATE TABLE statements, or
   after the table is created with the ALERT TABLE statement

   Syntex:

   CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype constraint,
    column2 datatype constraint,
    column3 datatype constraint,
   );

   commonly used constraint:

   --> Not NULL - ensure that column cannot have a NULL value
   --> UNIQUE - ensure that all value in a column are different
   --> Primary Key - a combination of not NULL and unique
   --> Foreign KEY: prevent the actions that would destroy links between tables
   --> CHECK: ensure that the value in a column satisfied a specific condition
   --> Default: Set a default value for column if no value is specified
   --> Create index :used to create and retrive data from database very quickly
