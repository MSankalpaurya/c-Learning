 I think it is typo error from Sankalp.
 But let me be clear here that Potohole and Speed Breaker detection has nothing to do with SVC, which is a separate project.

Hi Sankalp,

I hope you mean this repository ( Pothole and Speed Breaker Detection: https://github.com/the-chet/speedbreaker-pothole-detector ) and not SVC. Please correct if my understanding is not correct.

Regards,

Hitanshu

 Hi Sir,
 
 I have completed my part of the AI/ML task. The only remaining part is the detection with the model, as the model training is still in progress.
 
 I will hand over the code to Arun and explain my work so far so that he can seamlessly move it forward.
 
 Afterward, as per the next task, I will convert SVC repository to C++ code within our feature application architecture.
 
 Best regards,
 Sankalp Maurya
